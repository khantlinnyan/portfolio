    for the past 2years. I have good communication and soft skills, which
    makes me a friendly person to work with. I really enjoy attending meetup
    events and hackathons, as they are fun and give me a chance to learn and
    showcase my skills. I also have a minimalist approach to design,
    focusing on creating clean and user-friendly websites. I'm excited to
    continue my journey in frontend development and keep improving my
    skills."
